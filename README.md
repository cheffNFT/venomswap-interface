# An open source interface for Cardano Dexes

Hi this is CHEFF! Feel free to ask anything you want in the discord channel. This is a fork from ViperSwap which by the way, a fork from Uniswap! I wanted to use this basecode because I'm fan of ViperSwap but not everybody like snakes üêç so I changed to my own theme of food and chef's. Another main goal of this project is to allow the main ideas and features of a Dex like swap tokens and provide liquidity!

Feel free to contribute, have ideas and submit PR's, this project is React so expect a little bit of mess here and there!

Happy cooking. üë©‚Äçüç≥

This code is based in Uniswap.
